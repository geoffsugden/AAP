I'm hacking together an integration between my Alarm and Home Assistant. In a large part to help me get back into coding. 
Any feedback is appreciated. 

If you're wanting a more proffesional integration have a look at https://github.com/thanoskas/arrowhead_alarm (no affiliation). 

I have an ECi panel and purchased a serial module for it. Connected using a Serial Device Server USR-TCP232-302.
